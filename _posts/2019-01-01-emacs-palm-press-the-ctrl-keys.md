title: "Use your palms to press the Control keys in Emacs"

I'm not saying anything or pretend to have discovered anything new
here. I'm just confirming and trying to convince other Emacs zealots
or newbies alike that [Xah Lee](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/swap_CapsLock_Ctrl.html)'s ten year old advice to palm-press
both Ctrl keys instead of [swaping](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MovingTheCtrlKey) to CapsLock and use your pinky
is not only sound but it's one of the best small things I've learned
during these years. I cannot even imagine what a living hell my Emacs
life would be if not for the pinkie freedom and the ability to use
both Ctrl keys at the same time and thus not having the need to use a
modal editor, like Vim.

# How to use your palm to press the Control key

So, normally, you would hold your hands on the [home row](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hrk.htm). That is,
your fingers are on `a`, `s`, `d`, `f` and the `j`, `k`, `l` and `;`
keys, respectively:

In this position, which incidentally is the correct position to type
anything of value into a computer, both palms rest naturally on the
Control keys. In the next instance, both Control and the `p` key are
pressed at the same time. This is the `previous-line`, a most used
command in the Emacs world.

Do you notice any big difference regarding the position of the hands?
Notice the left hand palm is pressed against the Control key. Barely
noticeable. Next, both the Control key and the `q` key are pressed
with the same minimal effort.

Two things can be readliy observed. One, is that both Control keys are
used. When the key to be pressed is on the left side of the keyboard,
the right Control key is used and when the key is on the right, the
left Control key. Secondly, and most important, the hands retain their
natural, home row position and you don't see any finger contortions
and bone breaking athletics. This both increases your typing speed and
saves you from RSI.

In the video above, the key combinations used are C-p, C-n, C-g, C-q,
C-c followed by C-TAB, some typing and then C-m, likely some of the
most used keys. Doesn't it look natural?

# Where to start

Start by reading Steve Yegge's rant that Xah Lee also links in his
post, if you're somehow not convinced that you should really touch
type before ever writing another piece of code. It's about [learning
how to f***
type](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html)
and Steve here will yell at you for coming up with excuses for not
learning. Really, you have none. Unlike sport coaches, there is now an
endless supply of tools that can help you on this journey, and the
journey consists in repeating the same patterns over and over again,
starting from simple exercises like pressing just a single key, or a
random combination of five keys, or ten, but making sure you keep your
hands where you're supposed to: on the home row. I've used
[klavaro](https://sourceforge.net/projects/klavaro/), but you can try
what suits you best, and I've went from 50-60 words per minute (wpm)
to 99 wpm.

I'm still trying to beat the 100 mark. I'm sure that moment will
come. How fast can you go? [Try
it](https://typing-speed-test.aoeu.eu/?lang=en) now and then try again
in a few months and see the difference.

If you're just starting with Emacs, first learn how to touch type as
this will help you regardless if you'll like and continue to use Emacs
in the future, and then learn how to use your palm to press the Ctrl
keys. I don't think you're getting the full Emacs experience otherway
and you'll start swearing at the awkward keyboard shortcuts, start
going for the mouse and click the horrible menus and at that moment
you'll be 10 times slower at your craft than what Emacs can offer out
of the box.

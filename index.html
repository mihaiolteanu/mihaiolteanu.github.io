<!-- <h1> Who </h1> -->

<p>Software developer. Common Lisper. Emacs user. (Arch)Linux & shells
  100% of the time.
</p>

<p> I like small and composable tools and interactive development
  environments and not the big, monolithic and closed apps that try to
  do everything but get along with no one. Incidentally, that might be
  the reason for <a href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a>
  success. Hmm.
</p>

<p> I have been working for many years as an embedded C software
developer in the automotive industry. My background is in electrical
engineering and at one time I've even built my own minimal z80
computer with discrete logic gates, RAM and ROM modules inspired by
the <a href="http://cpuville.com/Kits/Computer-kit.html">CPUville's
Kit Instruction Manual</a> or hacked
the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24Q59ZTOJ9TU4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1498712436">XinuOS</a>
internals. Fun times.

<p> As of late, I've been bitten by the Lisp bug following
the <a href="http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/">SICP</a>'s
recipes. Now I'm starting to see all these XML files
(<a href="https://automotive.wiki/index.php/AUTOSAR_XML_Schema">arxml</a>, <a href="https://www.defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html">ant</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid">liquid</a>, etc) as the
inability of the languages that use them to express or to build higher
abstractions. The "solution" seems to be an explosion of new DSLs built
on top of XML which, by its
very <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp">definition</a>
<i> does not DO anything </i>. A perfect, though inferior, medium to
build your own abstractions. All for the simple reason that the main
tool is not powerful enough.
</p>

<p> Picking up new languages is a task for a few weeks once the
fundamentals concepts are in place, or so I've seen. I've skimmed the
surface of Rust, Elixir and a few others and have <i>I wish I knew
more about that</i> moments every time I hear about Prolog, Smalltalk,
OCaml or other little known
gems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)">J</a>,
maybe?!

<h2> Articles & Projects </h2>
<br/>
<a href="/muse-player">Last.fm like music player </a>
<p> A Common Lisp, mouseless music player for a brighter future. A
  reimplementation of last.fm's functionality but
  with <a href="https://stumpwm.github.io/">StumpWM</a> (or dmenu)
  integration thus getting rid of the browser. Project under development.
</p>

<a href="/emacs-palm-press-the-ctrl-keys">Use your palms to press
    the Control keys in Emacs</a>
<p> A plea, again, for all Emacs lovers out there, to properly use
  their keyboards and stop switching Control for CapsLock. Oh, and
  learn how to actually (touch) type!</p>

<a href="/counsel-sly">Emacs counsel-sly</a>
<p> Add counsel support for Sylvester the Cat's Common Lisp IDE (sly)
 in Emacs.
</p>

<a href="https://github.com/mihaiolteanu/metacircular">SICP's
    Scheme Interpreter written in C</a>
<p> A learning project that reimplements the SICP's metacircular
  evaluator from scratch in C. I got it to the point where I can start
  a REPL, define new functions and evaluate expressions. Unit tests
  are also in place for a safer journey.
</p>

<a href="/circuiteelectrice">Lessons in Electronic Circuits</a>
<p> A Romanian translation project I've started over ten years ago for
  this excellent resource for students of electronics. A printed
  edition was in the works, but it was just not meant to be. I've
  managed to save this from old archives as the original website got
  hacked, cleaned it with some nice awk&sed and transformed it from
  html to org files. The html pages are now automatically generated
  with shell scripts on each new update.
</p>

<a href="https://github.com/mihaiolteanu/xinu-beaglebone-howto">How
    to download and boot the Xinu Os from a BeagleBone Black</a>
<p>I've had some problems booting up XinuOS on the BBB, as it seems nobody was
  feeding the watchdog. Some microcontroller documentation reading and
  hacking solved it.
